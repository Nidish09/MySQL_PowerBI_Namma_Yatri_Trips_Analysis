As a Data Analyst, I have developed a comprehensive set of SQL queries to analyze and summarize crucial information from a ridesharing company's database. These queries cover various aspects of the business, from trip statistics to payment methods, cancellations, and customer behavior.

•	Total trips, drivers, and earnings are fundamental metrics, while total completed trips provide insight into operational efficiency.

•	Analyzing search behavior, driver cancellations, and customer actions helps understand user engagement.

•	Calculating average distance and fare per trip provides insights into ride characteristics.

•	Identifying the most used payment method and highest payment instrument offers valuable financial insights.

•	Determining locations with the most trips and top-earning drivers helps optimize resource allocation.

•	Examining trip duration and identifying popular driver-customer pairs can inform marketing strategies.

•	Estimating rates for search to estimate, estimate to search for quotes, and quote acceptance rates helps assess user interaction.

•	Identifying top-performing locations in terms of fares, cancellations, and trips allows for strategic planning.

•	Finding the duration with the highest trips and fares helps optimize service during peak periods.

Furthermore, I have also created a Power BI dashboard for visualizing and tracking these key metrics. This dashboard provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for stakeholders to monitor the ridesharing business's performance in real-time. It includes various charts, graphs, and tables that offer a holistic view of the company's operations and user behavior.
